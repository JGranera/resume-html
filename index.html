    <h2>Statement</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a screenwriter turned software engineer. I transitioned from
      filmmaking to tech after realizing the creative problem-solving skills I
      used in writing are equally valuable in coding. I'm passionate about
      creating impactful products and love the collaborative nature of software
      engineering.
